    <h3><b> Introduction </h3> </b>
    <p>White Sauce Pasta is simply cooked pasta mixed with a silky smooth & decadent white sauce made of milk, butter and flour. It is also known as Bechamel Sauce has its origin from the Italian & French Cuisines. In classic culinary terms, this is what is known as a mother sauce.</p>
    <p>I came up with this white spaghetti sauce recipe one night to serve with dried pasta and spicy battered shrimp. My husband lived in Italy for three years, so he's really picky about his Italian cuisine. He loved this sauce and thought I spent all day on dinner. It is really hard to mess up this kind of white sauce. In my opinion, it's similar to Alfredo sauce but without cheese.</p>
