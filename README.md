# odin-recipes
This is a simple HTML project where I'm making a basic recipe website as part of The Odin Project. The web will have different types of recipes and useful links will be provided for the reader. Different sets of headings, paragraphs and images will be used to make the content engaging for readers.

The web will also be designed with accessibility in mind for users who rely on screen readers.

Skills Demonstrated:

Making a structured HTML webpage
Adding images to webpage
Making web Accessibile for screen readers
